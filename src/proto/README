XML Notes

We use entities to indicate repetition; attributes to indicate properties.

We use the 'name' attribute as an identifier, usually within the context
of the surrounding entities.

We use spaces to separate words in names, so that we can print names in
their natural form depending on the context - underlines for source code,
hyphens for written text, etc.

We do not enforce any particular validation mechanism but we support all
mechanisms.  The protocol definition conforms to a formal grammar that is
published separately in several technologies.
